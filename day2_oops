OOPS is Object Oriented Programming , it is all about objects and classes, we will see all the entities in programming as *Objects*.
The object is constructed as a class as a blueprint. 
For example, we will take bike as an object and in that there are some properties and functions, so that inside class we will have all those properties and functions.
We will see everything as an object in this oops.
