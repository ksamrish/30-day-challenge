Polymorphism generally means many forms.
In programming, polymorphism is divided into compile time and run time polymorphism.
Compile time polymorphism is overloading. And run time is overriding.
overloading means signature same, but we do it for different datatypes or addition terms
overriding is we may override the parent method to other properties or function and overwrite it.
