Compiler is something which whole code is checked and get run for us, it will let us know errors of the whole code when compiling, and so we will correct errors and run code without error
Interpreter is something that it is running code line by line, and it will run until error comes in further lines of code.
Compiler is better, if we work for a project and it will let us know if any errors come when compiling, so that its also a compiled file of code and we will run anytime if we required.
